  <h3> About </h3>
</div>

<p id="About"> Kerala, a state in Southern India is known as a tropical paradise
    of waving palms and wide sandy beaches. It is a narrow strip of coastal
    territory that slopes down the Western Ghats in a cascade of lush green
    vegetation, and reaches to the Arabian sea. Kerala borders the states of
    Tamil Nadu to the east and Karnataka to the north. It is also known for its
    backwaters, mountains, coconuts, spices and art forms like Kathakali and
    Mohini Attam. It is the most literate state in India, and a land of diverse
    religions, where you can find Hindu temples, mosques, churches, and even
    synagogues. With world class tourist sporting options, ayurvedic spas and
    treatments, eco-tourism initiatives, a large number of visit options ranging
    from beautiful high altitude blue mountains to pristine rain forests to golden
    sun-sand beaches and an enormous range of accommodation, Kerala has much to
    offer the visitor.
